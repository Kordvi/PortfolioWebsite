<h1> My Portfolio Website</h1>

This is the first version of my portfolio website, 
it makes use of bootstrap for the navbar and some layout elements.
The website has a single page that fits well on a browser or a phone,
and the structure to include future projects to flesh out the portfolio section.
It allows users to assess if they are interested in me/my work and contact me.

<h3>Deployment</h3>

This website was created using Visual Studio, a local git repository was used for version control,
and then uploaded to Github. The site will be hosted using Git pages. 
To do this I initiated the git repository with 'git init', 
then used 'git status' to see which of my un-tracked files had not been added to the new repository.
I used 'git commit -m "added in a specific message" to commit my changed files to the repository. 
Once my files were committed I used 'git push' to push all my new and changed files to GitHub before making it live with Git pages. 
I did this every time I made major changes to any part of my site.
