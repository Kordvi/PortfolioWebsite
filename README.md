#### My Portfolio Website

This is the first version of my portfolio website, 
it makes use of bootstrap for the navbar and some layout elements.
The website has a few pages that are clearly accessible,
and the structure to include future projects to flesh out the portfolio section.
It allows users to assess if they are interested in me/my work and contact me.

##UI

This project is relatively mobile friendly I believe from the coding perspective,
although that is untested, likely still a few kinks to work out.

##Technologies Used

*Unordered* HTML
*Unordered* CSS
*Unordered* Bootstrap
*Unordered* Git
*Unordered* Github

##Testing

1. Nav Bar 

Does the Nav Bar hold its position across the pages?

Does the Nav Bar work on different browsers?

2. Social Links

Click on the FaceClick on the Facebook Icon and confirm it opens up my Facebook page in a seperate browser.

Click on the Twitter Icon and confirm it opens up my Twitter page in a seperate browser.

Click on the Instagram Icon and confirm it opens up my Instagram page in a seperate browser.

Click on the LinkedIn Icon and confirm it opens up my LinkedIn page in a seperate browser.

Click on the Twitch Icon and confirm it opens up my Twitch page in a seperate browser.

3. Email Link

Click on the Email link and confirm it opens default email software correctly.

4. Viewing on a mobile and tablet

Confirm that when viewing on a mobile or tablet, the site has appropriate spacing and content.

##Deployment

This website was created using Visual Studio, a local git repository was used for version control,
and then uploaded to Github. The site will be hosted using Git pages. 
To do this I initiated the git repository with 'git innit', 
then used 'git status' to see which of my un-tracked files had not been added to the new repository.
I used 'git commit -m "added in a specific message" to commit my changed files to the repository. 
Once my files were committed I used 'git push' to push all my new and changed files to GitHub before making it live with Git pages. 
I did this every time I made major changes to any part of my site.
